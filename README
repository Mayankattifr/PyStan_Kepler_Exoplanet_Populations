First, we are implementng a powerlaw parameterization for planet radius and perido/insolation using the PyStan No Uturn MCMC sampler, in order to calculate occurrence rates based off of work by Chris Burke and the open science blog post by Dan Foreman-Mackey: The original exopop.ipynb from Dan Foreman-Mackey, is found at http://dan.iel.fm/downloads/notebooks/exopop.ipynb, and the accompanying blog post is at http://dan.iel.fm/posts/exopop/ Some parts of this code were developed at the exoplanet population hackathon by Ravi and Joe Catanzarite.

8/15/2016 This PyStan model version uses pre-computed completeness as input, for testing and developement.

8/18/2016 We now have a working version of the power law occurrence rate model using PyStan that agrees with the results from the Burke calculations and the DFM python notebook blog post implementation. Now we will add radius uncertanties into the completeness calculations.

8/19/2016 Changing code back to radius/period and adding radius uncertainties.

8/22/2016 Code has a switch to select period or insolation.
